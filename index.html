        <h1>Hello My Name Is Lokesh,<br> Today I Am Going To Tell About My Hobby Which Is Playing Football 
        </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team
            sport, in which you can score only by placing
            the ball inside the goal of the opposite team.
            Teams content 11 players – field players and a
            goalkeeper. The goalkeeper’s role is to protect
            the goal. He’s the only person that can touch
            the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty
            area. There are also 3 men which are not
            playing, these are the refferees.<br>Personally I play football for both training and
            fun. Many contacts with the ball improve the
            technique, and moving on the pitch builds the
            condition. Additionaly scoring a goal or
            blocking a dangerous shot is a really nice
            feeling, what makes football a good game for
            minimizing the stress. It’s good to have an onfield idol, that you can watch to improve your
            skills. My idol is Kaka’, because I love the way
            he dribbles and passes.<br>While playing, you must remember that
            football is a team game. Individual actions
            may be satisfying, but there’s more pleasure
            from the game when you remember about the
            teamwork. Moreover playing as a team is
            much more effective, and when there’s
            chemistry between the teammates, you can
            beat stronger or even more skilled oponents.
            Football is based on teamwork and that’s the
            best part of it in my opinion.</p>
